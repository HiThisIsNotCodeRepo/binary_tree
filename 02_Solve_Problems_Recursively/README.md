# Solve Problems Recursively

In previous sections, we have introduced how to solve tree traversal problem. And we tried to solve preorder, inorder
and postorder traversal recursively.

Actually, recursion is one of the most powerful and frequently-used methods for solving tree related problems. We are
going to introduce two typical recursive solutions for solving tree-related problems.

After completing this chapter, you should be able to solve basic recursion problems related to a binary tree by
yourself.
