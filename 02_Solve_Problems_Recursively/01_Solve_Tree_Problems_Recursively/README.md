# Solve Tree Problems Recursively

In previous sections, we have introduced how to solve tree traversal problems recursively. Recursion is one of the most
powerful and frequently used techniques for solving tree problems.

As we know, a tree can be defined recursively as a node(the root node) that includes a value and a list of references to
children nodes. Recursion is one of the natural features of a tree. Therefore, many tree problems can be solved
recursively. For each recursive function call, we only focus on the problem for the current node and call the function
recursively to solve its children.

Typically, we can solve a tree problem recursively using a top-down approach or using a bottom-up approach.
