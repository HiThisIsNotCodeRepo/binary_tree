# Traverse a Tree-Introduction

*Pre-order Traversal*

Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree.
Here is an example:

Note: in the following animation, the highlighting in red indicates that we return from the visit of the node. The order
of the visit is indicated on the array right below the binary tree.

*In-order Traversal*

In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

Let's do in-order traversal together:

Typically, for binary search tree, we can retrieve all the data in sorted order using in-order traversal. We will
mention that again in another card(Introduction to Data Structure - Binary Search Tree).
